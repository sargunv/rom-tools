## Tips

- When adding libraries, use `go get` to get the latest version
- When looking up how to use standard libraries or packages, use `go doc` to read the documentation
- The Screenscraper API documentation is in @api/SCREENSCRAPER_API.md
- The Screenscraper API is in French, but our client library and CLI are in English
